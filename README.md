Movie Ticket App
This is a student assignment project that automates the creation of movie shows and seating arrangements using Firebase Realtime Database. It demonstrates a simple movie ticket management system, including room creation, showtime scheduling, and seat allocation.

# Features
- Room Creation: Automatically generate rooms in the database.
- Showtimes Scheduling: Create movie showtimes for the next 14 days with random time slots.
- Seat Arrangement: Assign seating arrangements for each showtime.
- User Registration: Register new users with Firebase.
- Browse Movies: Allow users to browse available movies and showtimes.
- Firebase Integration: All data is saved and managed in Firebase Realtime Database.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Xamarin.Forms development environment.
- Firebase Realtime Database account.
  
## 2. Firebase Realtime Database Setup
To use the app with Firebase Realtime Database, follow these steps:

### Create a Firebase Project:
1. Go to Firebase Console.
2. Create a new project and enable Firebase Realtime Database.
3. Set Firebase Realtime Database Rules: If you are just testing the app without authentication, set the following rules to allow read and write access:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth == null",
    ".write": "auth == null"
  }
}
```
> OR, if you're using authentication, configure your rules accordingly.

Database Indexing Rules: Add the following indexing rules to optimize database queries:
```
{
  "rules": {
    "RoomTimeTable": { ".indexOn": ["Date"] },
    "RoomSeatTable": { ".indexOn": ["TimeRefId"] },
    "UserTable": { ".indexOn": ["UserRefId", "Phone", "Id", "Email"] },
    "TicketTable": { ".indexOn": ["UserId"] }
  }
}
```

# Installation
## 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/LaoSeng99/xamarin-miao-movie.git
```
## 2. Set Firebase Realtime Database URL
Open the project file at /Firebase/Firebase/Firebase.cs.

Replace the Firebase URL placeholder with your Firebase Realtime Database URL:
```
public static FirebaseClient firebase = new FirebaseClient("https://{your-firebase-project}.firebasedatabase.app");
```

## 3. Firebase Authentication (Optional)
If you have set up Firebase Authentication, complete the authentication setup in the project:

Integrate Firebase Auth in the /Firebase/FirebaseAuth.cs file.

Follow the official [Firebase Authentication documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to configure your authentication methods.

### Usage
- Running the Project
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the project on your emulator or physical device.
- App Functionality
- Room Creation: Automatically create rooms in the database.
- Showtimes Scheduling: Generate movie showtimes for the next 14 days, with random time slots.
- Seat Arrangement: Assign seats for each showtime.
- Firebase Integration: All data is saved and retrieved from Firebase Realtime Database.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Firebase URL Error: Ensure that you correctly replace the Firebase URL in the /Firebase/Firebase/Firebase.cs file.
Database Rules Error: Make sure the Firebase Realtime Database rules are set correctly, as shown above.
Authentication Issues: If using Firebase Auth, ensure proper configuration by following Firebaseâ€™s documentation.

4. Note to Users
If you are trying this app for testing purposes, please make sure to update your Firebase database rules as follows:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth == null",
    ".write": "auth == null"
  }
}
```

This will allow you to use the app without setting up Firebase Authentication. However, for production use, it is strongly recommended to configure proper authentication and security rules in Firebase.
